# c-programming-security

C programming examples that cover basic operations, pointer usage, pointer
arithmetic, random numbers, time operations, and other examples like small
applications and security exploits.

## Installation

Start by downloading and building the project when necessary. The following
commands will do the job on most Debian based Linux distributions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcbperez/c-programming-security
cd c-programming-security
sudo ./gradlew
```

## Usage

After the installation process the sources will be compiled inside the
`build/exe` folder. Each executable is organized in its own sub folder, to run
it follow the example below:

```bash
cd build/exe
./addressof/addressof
```

## Testing

Test checks are executed automatically every time the project is built. Builds
can be done remotely or continuously on a development context. For continuous
integration and development use docker-compose. This is recommended to keep the
system clean while the project is built every time the sources change.

```bash
sudo docker-compose up
```

For continuous integration and development without any dependencies use the
Gradle wrapper. This is the best option if the wrapper is available and the
Docker context is not valid. For a full list of tasks, see
`sudo ./gradlew tasks --all`. For a CI cycle use `sudo ./gradlew --continuous`.

For continuous integration and development without Docker or the project wrapper
use Gradle directly. This will create the wrapper in case it is not present.
Similar to the above, for a CI cycle use `sudo gradle --continuous`. Gradle
3.4.1 is required for this to work. Plain Docker is also available for remote
integration tasks and alike. Build the image with `sudo docker build .` and run
a new container with it. Information on how to install Docker and docker-compose
can be found in their [official page][install-docker-compose]. A similar
installation guide is available [for Gradle][install-gradle].

## Troubleshooting

The [issue tracker][issue-tracker] intends to manage and compile bugs,
